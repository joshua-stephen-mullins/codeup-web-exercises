<h1>Cool Facts</h1>

<h3 id="evergladesTitle">Everglades</h3>
<ul id="evergladesList">
    <li class="evergladesItem">No. 1: It’s a river
        Believe it or not, the Everglades is actually a river that’s constantly moving, which works great for an
        Everglades airboat tour . Water trickles from north to south from Lake Okeechobee, forming a slow-moving river
        that’s sixty miles wide and a hundred miles long. But the “River of Grass” is much smaller than it was in years
        past. As much as fifty percent of the wetland habitat has been destroyed by construction and related drainage
        projects.
    </li>
    <li class="evergladesItem">No. 2: It’s the only place in the world where alligators and crocodiles coexist
        Both crocodiles and gators live in the Everglades. Crocs are mostly found in small numbers in coastal areas of
        the ‘glades, while alligators prefer to stay inland, near freshwater. Nevertheless, the Everglades ecosystem
        provides a natural habitat for both, and it’s the only place in the world where these reptiles co-exist in the
        wild.
    </li>
    <li class="evergladesItem">No. 3: Fire is common in the Everglades – and important
        When most people think of the Everglades, they imagine swampland and trips down the water on Everglades boat
        tours, murky waters. While that’s true, there’s also a very distinctive dry season where weather patterns create
        drought-like conditions that are perfect for fire. What many people don’t realize is that fire is actually an
        essential part of maintenance, clearing the way for a complex system of interdependent ecosystems to thrive.

<h3 id="zionTitle">Zion National Park</h3>
<ul id="zionList">
    <li class="zionItem">1. Before it was a national park, Zion was a national monument, and it’s name wasn’t Zion. The park was first
        protected in 1909 when President William Howard Taft designated Mukuntuweap National Monument using the power of
        the 1906 Antiquities Act. In the 10 years until it became a national park, it was expanded, and its name was
        changed to Zion. Today, Zion preserves 229 square miles of red rock landscape that’s so stunning it looks
        surreal.
    </li>
    <li class="zionItem">2. Zion is home to one of the greatest engineering feats of modern times. In 1909, Zion was virtually
        inaccessible to visitors because of poor road conditions and limited railway. Once Zion became a national park,
        people wanted to explore it. To make this possible, construction began on a 25-mile stretch of road to connect
        Zion to the Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon. Completed in 1930, the Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway and Tunnel is a must
        see. The 1.1-mile-long tunnel cuts through the vertical sandstone cliffs of Zion, blends in with the surrounding
        landscape and includes windows to provide views of Zion Canyon. When the tunnel opens up, drivers are left in
        awe of the spectacular beauty.
    </li>
    <li class="zionItem">N3. Zion is more than just slot canyons and amazing hikes -- it also protects archeological sites. People have
        called the canyons and plateaus of Zion National Park home for over 10,000 years. The remnants of their time
        here exist throughout the park. From humble granaries to improbable highways, these structures stand as
        testaments to the ingenuity of those that came before us.
